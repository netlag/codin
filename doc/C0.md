# C0

The codin compiler translates Odin to a subset of C called C0. C0 can be compiled by any regular C compiler but is a much smaller and better defined language that allows Odin to be translated to C "safely" without invoking undefined behavior. C0 is treated more like an intermediate representation (IR). C0 is not a single-static-assignment (SSA) IR.

## Instructions
C0 defines a multitude of instructions which everything is translated to. The codin compiler emits a special "prelude" which implements these instructions as functions which are forced-inlined allowing it to be compiled by a regular C compiler without any of the overhead of the function call under minimal optimization.

As an example, consider the following expression in Odin where every variable here is a `i32`.
```odin
a := b + c * d;
```

This would be translated to the following C0
```c
wri32(&a, addi32(b, muli32(c, d)));
```

You can see that every instruction is typed.

The special prelude which codin would emit for the generated C0 so that it can be compiled by a regular C compiler would look something like the following.
```c
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
#define FORCE_INLINE __forceinline
#else
#define FORCE_INLINE __attribute__((always_inline)) inline
#endif

FORCE_INLINE void wri32(i32 *dst, i32 src) {
	*dst = src;
}

FORCE_INLINE i32 addi32(i32 lhs, i32 rhs) {
	const i64 a = lhs;
	const i64 b = rhs;
	const i64 s = a + b;
	return (i32)(sum & INT64_C(0xffffffff));
}

FORCE_INLINE i32 muli32(i32 lhs, i32 rhs) {
	const i64 a = lhs;
	const i64 b = rhs;
	const i64 s = a * b;
	return (i32)(sum & INT64_C(0xffffffff));
}
```

You can see the `addi32` and `muli32` functions emitted are slightly different to how one would expect to write them, this is because Odin requires signed integer underflow to wrap. These functions implement that behavior without any actual cost. All the tested C compilers are capable of optimizing these even at the lowest optimization setting, e.g:
```c
i32 foo(i32 x) {
	return addi32(x, 4096);
}
```
Becomes the following at the lowest optimization level.
```
foo(int):
        lea     eax, [rdi+4096]
        ret
```

The main design goal of C0 is to map Odin's semantics better for C and to enable future translation to other optimizing compiler frameworks or directly to machine code. The C prelude is strictly only necessary to make the IR compile with a regular C compiler and can be omitted in future cases of more direct translation. C0 is literally just C but simple enough to also be an IR in the same language.

There is also a bunch of `cvt_a_b` instructions which convert {i,u}{8,16,32,64,128} and f{16,32,64} between each other which are not listed here since there's too many permutations of them.

> The `memcpy` and `memset` instructions are used to initialize variables from literals, but also exists as regular special intrinsics for optimization purposes to help eliminate dead stores and to allow `transmute` to be implemented in a safe way.

There is no pointer arithmetic.

## Syntax
Since C0 is a very minimal subset of the C language it requires little effort to parse so it makes for a good IR as-is. There is no operators because all operations translate to function calls.

### Types
C0 defines the following types. Types are really only necessary for variables as all instructions are typed.

| Type   | C type                         |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| `i8`   | `signed char`                  |
| `u8`   | `unsigned char`                |
| `i16`  | `signed short`                 |
| `u16`  | `unsigned short`               |
| `i32`  | `signed int`                   |
| `u32`  | `unsigned int`                 |
| `i64`  | `signed long long`             |
| `u64`  | `unsigned long long`           |
| `i128` | `signed __128i` or software    |
| `u128` | `unsigned __i128` or software  |
| `f16`  | `half` software                |
| `f32`  | `float`                        |
| `f64`  | `double`                       |
| `ptr`  | `void*`                        |

> The usual pointer and array versions of these types also exist.

> Only 1D array types are supported

### Punctuation
The punctuation is minimal.

| Punctuation | Name           |
|-------------|----------------|
| `&`         | Address        |
| `*`         | Dereference    |
| `()`        | Call           |
| `,`         | Comma/Sequence |
| `;`         | Semicolon      |
| `{}`        | Scope          |

### Literals
The regular int, float, and string literals are supported within C0, they just
cannot be used as rvalues since no assignment operation exists. They're only
usable as literals to instructions.

### Control flow
The following control flow statements exist.

| Statement  |
|------------|
| `if`       |
| `else`     |
| `for`      |
| `continue` |
| `break`    |
| `switch`   |
| `return`   |
| `goto`     |

### Records
The `struct` and `union` record types are both used too.

## Example
Here's a trivial example of Odin compiled to C0

```odin
factorial :: (n: int) -> int {
	if n == 0 do return 1;
	return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

```c
i64 factorial(i64 n) {
	if (eqi64(n, 0)) return 1;
	return muli64(n, factorial(subi64(n, 1)));
}
```

The prelude would look something like the following.
```c
#define FORCE_INLINE __attribute__((always_inline)) inline

typedef signed long i64;
typedef signed __int128 i128;

FORCE_INLINE int eqi64(i64 a, i64 b) {
	return a == b;
}

FORCE_INLINE i64 muli64(i64 a, i64 b) {
	const i128 lhs = a;
	const i128 rhs = b;
	const i128 sum = lhs * rhs;
	return (i64)(sum & 0xffffffffffffffffull);
}

FORCE_INLINE i64 subi64(i64 a, i64 b) {
	const i128 lhs = a;
	const i128 rhs = b;
	const i128 sum = lhs - rhs;
	return (i64)(sum & 0xffffffffffffffffull);
}
```

Which when compiled together would generate the following assembly, even on the lowest optimization setting. We have well-defined to wrap signed integer underflow too.
```
factorial(long):
        mov     eax, 1
        test    rdi, rdi
        jne     .L8
        ret
.L8:
        push    rbx
        mov     rbx, rdi
        lea     rdi, [rdi-1]
        call    factorial(long)
        mul     rbx
        pop     rbx
        ret
```
